Hey! I'm Devin Mui

I'm a high school student enthusiastic about programming, robotics, AI, and much much more! Currently, I lead our school's projects club as Software Director.

At the moment, I know these things pretty well:

* Javascript
* Python
* Ruby on Rails
* Arduino
* C/C++
* Android development

And I've dabbed in a bunch of other things too:

* OpenCV
* machine learning
* Hardware development
* CUDA
* AWS
* a few other things that aren't worth putting on this list
